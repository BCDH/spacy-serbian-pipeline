## Data files

For testing training, we're using the UD dataset, which has been automatically converted to Cyrillic. This is temporary. We will eventually use our own training data.

### Lemmatizer data

- data originates from Morpho-SLaWS (Tasovac, Rudan and Rudan 2015) and Transpoetika (Tasovac 2012)
- currently includes both Ekavian and Jekavian forms, I may move Jekavians to the normalization function
